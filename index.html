			<h1> <span class="asterisk">✴︎</span> Dreaming: Behind the Scenes of Our Intimate, yet Collective <span class="asterisk">✴︎</span>  </h1>
      <h1> This thesis originates from the most sincere and personal fascination with dreams. I have entered this research with some basic elements of knowledge on dreams – I was only slightly familiar with the studies of dream symbolism, as well as with other aspect such as sleep phases. Nonetheless, I dare to call myself a passionate dreamer. I envision dreams as little capsules of stories of various kinds, which hold a lot of mystery.</br> <br>Those little stories composed of memories, reflections and predictions, embraced by the powers of imagination are enlived at night, and while being personal, they are also universal, because dreaming unites us all and it is, principally, a shared experience.<br></br>This thesis explores dreamers and the dream world through four main concepts: <sup>1</sup><em> protocols of dream shareability and the historical deconstruction of dream intimacy;</em> <sup>2</sup><em> the relationship between the mechanisms of thought storage and dreaming;</em> <sup>3</sup> <em>the oneiric concept in cinema and</em> <sup>4</sup> <em> the notion of collective dreamscapes formed by the current influence of artificial intelligence and technologies. </em> As the red thread through the stories, histories and concepts I researched for this thesis, I always refer to my own experience as a dreamer, because I find it important to keep it intimate, too.

											<h2 id="intro-1">INTRODUCTION</h2>


										<div class="footnotes-style">
											<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“The images of the unconscious place a great responsibility upon a man. Failure to understand them, or a shirking of ethical responsibility, deprives him of his wholeness and imposes a painful fragmentariness on his life”</em> <sup>1</sup>
										</div>

										<p>
											For me, dreaming has always been a deeply intimate story that I would rather reflect upon it within myself. I often found myself in a process of dream analysis, mostly because dreams unfolded the narratives I would find unpleasant, disturbing or, perhaps, too complex for that moment in time. Those narratives would not always be heavy or ‘dark’, there would often be pleasant and light ones, too. Whenever a dream was pleasant, I would try to prolong the emotional impact of that dream, gleefully ‘soaking in the after-taste of it’, trying to take its mood into my awaken state.
										</p>

										<p>
											What makes me so eager to research the topic of dreams is it’s mystic nature, the subjectivity of interpretations and the ‘universality’ of the topic – in the end, we all dream, and we all would have something surprising to share about our personal dreaming experiences. As well as being interested in the topic from a historical research perspective, I was also once triggered by a conversation I had with my close friend. The conversation made me question why do we share similar re-occurring dream stories and why so differently, nonetheless, those similar narratives shape meaning. More than that, I was very fascinated by the fact that we dream of the same images of the surroundings and environments of the past. Both of us come from the same city in Russia – Cheboksary – but I suppose that’s not the reason to take for granted as of why we constantly find ourselves thrown back in time. Another aspect I found that caught my attention and informed my interest, is that the narration of our dreams would always be in dual time layers – we both would see the present-day ourselves, but clearly understand that the narration is happening in the past.
										</p>

										<p>
										A dream itself is something I inseparably associate with the ‘after-taste feeling’. Once the dream is over and I am awake, I am still ‘tasting’ the former dream with the emotional post-state it left me with. The same feeling one usually has after watching a film – one might be elevated, inspired or be totally on the other side of the emotional spectrum – devastated, concerned, wanting to unsees it, perhaps?  It is my goal with this thesis to guide you, the reader – and a dreamer! – towards having that dreamy ‘after-taste’ emotion – be it because you would start paying more attention to your dreams, or be it because you would appreciate the stories and histories that I will present to you in this writing.

										<h2 id="intro-2">The Fields Of Persimmons</h2>

										<p>
											I was seeing vast fields of persimmons, next to me was a person, we were walking through the fields towards an unknown point. I so badly wanted to taste one persimmon – it is, indeed, one of my favorite fruits. It was surreal:  the fruits were of unrealistic size, close to the size of watermelons, cut in halves and scattered all over the fields, they looked so juicy and so attractive; the person next to me seemed to be my mother, but we were walking in silence, almost like strangers. I felt so surely that I was with my mother, I felt that it was her.
											 In the end, I couldn’t steal a fruit, my mother said:
											“They will count one less, you can’t take it…”.
										</p>

										<p>
											This dream left me with a very frustrated after-taste feeling – lonely, lost and unsatisfied. I felt covered in this dream – while the dream is past for me, my awaken self isn’t quite there yet. Imagine having a take away coffee, but having to run to the stain station – you are having your nice beverage right in your hands and you can taste it, yet you also need to rush to the train and you can’t fully slow down to be in a moment of enjoying the coffee part. That’s the analogy that I hope explains what the after-taste of a dream is like – it’s like having a take away coffee.
										</p>

										<p>
											We share dreams to relate, to establish our connections as human beings living within a vast emotional spectrum. We also share dreams to show that we trust, and want to be trusted in turn. Dream sharing is a practice that has a long history and, interestingly, dream sharing played a big role in forming ‘collectivity’ and human wholeness.

												<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
												PROTOCOLS FOR DREAM SHARING</h2>

												<div class="footnotes-style">
													<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“In a lot of societies, in fact, there have been very elaborate techniques or protocols developed precisely to share dreams between people. To share them in a very careful and deliberate manner. So, for example, in Japan, before the 18th century, there was a set of poetic inventions, in which aristocrats would share their dreams and turn them into poems. In ancient Athens, in the Pacific North West, and many other cultures of various different kinds, people have been sent out into the woods, or to remote temples to dream and report back what they have seen in that dream.” </em> <sup>2</sup>
												</div>

											<p>
												To share a dream is a very intimate act, which can be sensitive for both the teller – to share it, and for the listener – to hear it. With psychotherapy becoming a regular practice for many of us, people ‘book’ their opportunities to be listened to and collectively reflect. Referring to dreaming experience is often essential when analyzing your mental state, because we all, some less and some more, get touched by our dreams. However, to identify what is too personal to share is a very fine line. Dream sharing is also a sign of trust and it is the responsibility of a teller to present the right depth of the details he or she has dreamt about.
											</p>

											<div class="footnotes-style">
												<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“(...) the dream is a knowledge of something of which I alone know.”</em> <sup>3</sup>
											</div>

											<p>
												The role of dreams back in history proves to be very different. Today dream sharing as an act manifests itself with primarily individualistic nature. In most of the cases dreams are told as monologues – be it sharing to a friend, family member or in a psychotherapist’s room. While dreams are, of course, reflected upon with help of an external person, the meaning of dreams is still utilized within the particular person’s  life. On the contrary, dream sharing of year back possesses collective nature and was used not solely in relation to the individual who shared it. Dreams were seen as portals to the other worlds, were broken down into symbols that were later de-coded to create a universal language of dream meanings. In short, dreams were collectively harnessed goods, as explained by Matthew Spellberg in an article titled On Dream Sharing and it’s Purpose: “In dream sharing, something from the depths of sleep is harnessed for use in the public world, in the community of the awoken.” <sup>4</sup>
											</p>

											<p>
												I first discovered the word ‘protocols’ in relation to ‘dreams’ in the same article by Matthew Spellberg, where he explains: “And yet, despite this vision of dreams as paradigmatically distant, many of the world’s cultures—especially outside of the modern West—have developed elaborate protocols by which dreams can be shared.” <sup>5</sup>  In my point of view, the relation between the words ‘protocols’ and ‘dreams’ is especially deep – compared to, for example, if we say ‘techniques’ or ‘approaches’. The term ‘protocols’ appears surprisingly more inclusive and broadens up the range of possible meanings.
											</p>

											<p>
												I would like to use the word ‘protocols’ to refer to the various stories that evolved in the history of dream sharing. Those protocols include, amongst many, objects, space and places, books and publications, rituals and guidelines developed by individuals or cultures.

														<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“The pillow, by elevating the head off the ground, remains the most essential prosthetic medium for inducing states of sleep and dreaming. The first pillows were carved from stone.”</em> <sup>6</sup>
													</div>

												<p>
													Going back to ancient Egypt, headrests were used for mummies to serve as amulets, which were believed to be saviors from the evil forces. In fact, stones have long been related to sleeping and dreaming due to their therapeutic properties: “(...) for instance, sleeping on jade was believed to cure insomnia and depression, enhance memory, and curtail hair loss. In more recent history, echoes of the lapidary treatise are found in alternative and New Age cultural practices, where the application of stones and minerals to the body is thought to have various oneiric functions. For example, within some New Age healing theories, it is believed that amethyst aids in transitioning from day to night, barite induces dreams and assists in their recollection, hematite promotes lucid dreaming, and rubies can safeguard one from nightmares.” <sup>7</sup> [fig.01]

												<p>
													In this way, minerals and stones have been holding an oneiric function, while in ancient times people also carved stone pillows – headrests [fig.02]  – especially to celebrate the dreaming mind and to honourably erect the dreaming head off the ground.

														Spacial Dreaming in a Pleasant Setting</h2>

													<p>
														The concept of collaborative inflatable architecture pieces appeared around 1960s —70s and it originated along with utopian vision on collective living and moment sharing. Characterized by the transparency, elasticity and flexibility, the spaces were commonly made of polyethylene and tape and it’s architectural characteristics allowed for lightness, spontaneity of living, movability, collectivity of time and spatial freedom. Most importantly, the architecture respectively freed the individual’s mind.
													</p>

													<p>
														One the examples of such inflatables is Ant’s Farm Pillow, installed in Point Reyes in 1969 —it was one the biggest inflatables of that time. [fig.03]
													</p>

													<img src="assets/images/favicon/antsfarm3.jpg" width=100%>
													<figcaption>[fig.03] Ant Farm’s 50' x 50' pillow installed at Point Reyes, California, 1970</figcaption>

													<p>
														As a product of counter-culture milieu, it was created to stand for freedom, alternativeness of a thought and collective exchange of liveness and ideas, as writes Matthew Spellberg in his article On Dream Sharing and it’s Purpose: “People could occupy Ant Farm’s air-filled pillows in various states of playful reverie, making them gigantic communal bubbles for collective dreaming.” <sup>8</sup>
													</p>

													<p>
														Interestingly, dreaming has not been the ultimate goal of a space like that, rather the goal was collectiveness of living, of which dreaming is an integral part of. Consequently, dreaming was ‘in the air’ and sharing of dreams manifested itself as a casual manner. What is very characteristic of this collective space is the setting of a pleasant environment – free, open and light, spreading the attitude of welcomeness and shareability.
													</p>

													<p>
														Inducing pleasant dreaming was also part of certain laboratory experiments. It was exactly the opposite architecture, small, dark, chamber – like space, restricted for movement and intentionally isolated. One of the examples is the sleep laboratory by an American neurologist Dr. J. Leonard Corning. [fig.05]
													</p>

													<img src="assets/images/favicon/lab.jpg" width=100%>
													<figcaption>[fig.05] J. Leonard Corning's tent for inducing pleasant dreams. Illustration from the St Louis Post-Dispatch, 4 June 1899.</figcaption>

													<p>
														The architecture of the laboratory was the following: “Corning constructed the makeshift mobile laboratory by draping a large tarp around a divan in order to create a dark private chamber. To instill a state of drowsiness in the patient, a stereoscope projected patterns of colored light while an Edison phonograph, attached to a specialized leather nightcap with rubber tubing, played music with minor chords and arpeggios, or, alternately, selections from the operas of Richard Wagner.” <sup>9</sup>
													</p>

													<p>
														The work by Ants Farm was an invention of people’s collective intention meant to be used routinely, while the latter – the laboratory – is primarily a scientific invention meant to be used selectively. Interestingly, those two examples show exactly the opposite approaches to spatial dreaming, yet they both were meant to induce pleasant dreaming.

											Dream Sharing Cultures</h2>

											<div class="footnotes-style">
												<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“We, in remembering and dreaming, make a web for all individuals to gain.”</em> <sup>10</sup>
											</div>

										<p>
											Perhaps the most powerful example of dream sharing practices can be traced back to certain small-scale cultures and tribes. Dreams were inseparable from the awaken lives and were gently nourished by the process of communal reflection and sharing. Dreams were a source for many different believes such as uniting with the parallel worlds and alternative souls, or on a more practical level, dreaming was also used as a method to suggest potential food sources:
										</p>

										<p>
											“For example, <em>The Amazonian Ese Eja</em> believe that, during dreaming, their spirit inhabits a parallel world populated by other spirits, including those of animals (Peluso, 2004). Similarly, the Amazonian Mehinaku believe each individual contains several types of souls distinct from their waking selves, one of which, the “eye soul,” is active during the night experiencing dreams but sleeps during the day (Gregor, 1981). Similarly, among the Andamanese Ongee society, discussion of sensory details from multiple individuals’ dreams is used to build consensus as to the probable locations of seasonal food sources (Pandya, 2004).” <sup>11</sup>
										</p>



										<p>
											I would like to specifically focus here on the Ongees of the Andaman Islands, who live in Southeast Asia at the Bay of Bengal, and are currently administered by India. Ongees were known for narrating to each other their dreams from the night before, and, by doing so, they meant to come closer together and align the mental spaces of each other, as has been researched and described by Matthew Spellberg in his article that I referred to above: “(…) they would negotiate the content of their dreams, modifying it so that everyone’s dream accounts might be gradually aligned with one another. One person might report having dreamt of fishing on the south beach of the island, another picking nuts on the west beach, then the first might suggest a compromise: We both went fishing in our dreams, but on the west beach.” <sup>12</sup> The explanation to the whole dream sharing ritual grounds on the communal ideology that shared makes stronger, more reliable, firmly bound community, which is, to my mind, beautifully said by Matthew Spellberg, too: “When the entire community talks through their dreams before sleeping, then the individual webs are woven together into a single web over the whole community”. <sup>13</sup>  I find it a truly wonderful example of how the Ongees grew and nurtured the communal strength and meaning through the ‘webs’ of individual dreaming experiences.

													I, MY OWN NOCTURNAL THERAPIST</h2>


												<p>
													The study of the mechanisms behind dreaming is a complex issue as the research on it has been conducted in various fields such as neuroscience and neurobiology, clinical medicine, psychiatry, psychology and philosophy, among many. The study models of each different field involves, to different extends, the study of the processes of memory and simulation, as I have found out in the following scientific paper: “The main models are grounded on the biological function of dreams, especially those based on processes involving the consolidation of memory and forgetting, and models of simulation.”<sup>14</sup>
												</p>

												<p>
													The aspect of memory, forgetting and thought simulation is a very fascinating one, because it is tied with an aspect of the controlled conscious. In an awake state, we can control the flow of the thoughts – accumulate those that are pleasant, or suppress those that are unwanted. In a unconscious state of dreaming, the cognitive processes are weakened due to chemical changes in the brain, so the control over the thoughts becomes practically impossible.
												</p>

												<p>
													In this chapter, I want to talk about the concept of thought suppression and how that influences dreaming scenarios. The concept of an unwanted thought suppression dates back to Freud’s psychodynamic theory. The mechanism of this theory is the following: if one suppresses unwanted thoughts or unpleasant memories while being awake, is it assumed that while being asleep, the mind will, most likely, process those suppressed ‘files’ into dreams.
												</p>

												<p>
													In line with that assumption lies another interesting theory called ‘Nocturnal Therapist’, according to which ‘(…) dreams can be seen as a ‘nocturnal therapist’ that helps a dreamer identify worries and concerns. The ‘nocturnal therapist’ has also been found to help find innovative solutions to problems: while dreaming, the mind attempts to solve a problem by looking at it from unusual perspectives”. <sup>15</sup> This theory as a very interesting perspective, the viewpoint of which I very much appreciate – I believe we shouldn’t fight our unconscious narratives, and once we establish a humble position, we start to appreciate the answers it gives us. Even though those answers might not come as a pleasant dream.

														<div class="footnotes-style">
															<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“Suppressing unpleasant thoughts can be tempting, as associated negative emotions may be avoided” </em> <sup>16</sup>
														</div>

													<p>
														To begin with, I would like to talk about a scientific experiment that has been conducted at the Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the Goethe Institute at Frankfurt am Main in the year of 2013, and what conclusions have been drawn out of that experiment. 30 healthy participants were investigated over the period of one week, and the dream content was assessed with a dream diary. The aim of the experiment was to define the effects of suppression of the intrusive thoughts on dream content and dream distress. The procedure was instructed as follows: “Focus your mind deliberately on the intrusive thought you selected before and concentrate on the negative feelings it triggers. Then, for the next five minutes, think about anything but the intrusive thought. Do not think about it, even for a fleeting moment, not even for a second, and do whatever it takes to keep that thought out of your mind. Then, go to bed’. The control group was instructed to think about whatever they wanted for approximately five min, after focusing their mind on the intrusive thought. ”<sup>17</sup> The outcomes demonstrated that deliberate suppression of the unwanted thoughts did translate into the dream content: “The results demonstrated increased target-related dreams and a tendency to have more distressing dreams in the suppression condition. Moreover, the data imply that thought suppression may lead to significantly increased general psychiatric symptomatology.” <sup>18</sup>
													</p>

													<p>
														As this experiment is one of many conducted in ‘sterile’ and highly monitored conditions, I would personally express doubt regarding the truthfulness of the outcome, primarily because of the guided and ‘pre-fabricated’ conditions of the experiment, which, to my mind, contradicts the intimate nature of sleeping and dreaming. In my experience, seeing unwanted scenarios in dreams is clearly liked to me suppressing those scenarios in an awaken state. When I reflect on this link, I understand that the longer I suppress the ‘unwanted’ or the ‘unpleasant’, the more dramatic and surreal the translation of that content in  my dreams is.
													</p>


													<p>
														There’s also numerous theories that examine the link between thought suppression and dreaming. For example, ironic control theory proposes the following: “However, ironic control theory (Wegner et al., 1987) proposes that suppressing thoughts leads to an increased occurrence of the suppressed content in waking states. According to Wegner et al. (2004), the interplay of two processes is responsible for this effect: first, a conscious operating process that is responsible for mental deflection by concentrating on content other than the target thought, and secondly, an unconscious monitoring process that controls for unwanted thoughts or intrusions, in order to test whether the operating process is needed. The operating process requires greater cognitive capacity. As soon as capacity is reduced, for example by cognitive demands (or sleep), the operating process is ‘weakened’ and unwanted thoughts become more accessible, because the monitoring process continues its activity. ”<sup>19</sup> The unwanted thought or intrusion might be a memory, a person, an object, place; it might be a look into the future or something that happened in the past. Importantly, all thought suppression theories have one aspect in common, which is persistence to the concept of the suppression itself: “It must be a thought or image that you have had before on more than one occasion.” <sup>17</sup>

																THE ONEIRIC METAPHOR IN FILMS</h2>


															<p>
																In my research on dreams, I often stumbled upon formulations such as ‘seeing a dream is like seeing a film’ and notions such as the oneiric nature of films. Consequently, it became clear that the relation between dreams and films is portrait as mutual, and that has intrigued me a lot. I started to question what are those specific characteristics that unite films and dreams and what makes the film oneiric? The latter question appeared to be of a bigger interest for me, because I got attracted to that seemingly mysterious notion of what <em>oneiric</em> is and I got very curious what <em>oneiric image</em> is like, specifically. Thus, in this chapter, I will shed the light on the notion of an oneiric image and take a specific path of analyzing the films of one of the greatest oneiric filmmakers – Andrei Tarkovsky.

																	Presence</h2>

																	<div class="footnotes-style">
																	</div>

																<p>
																	There are various aspects – visual and sensational – that unite films and dreams. I would like to start by  examining the aspect of <em>presence</em>.
																</p>


																<p>
																	Watching a film is a spectatorship – it triggers brain activity, develops emotional response, and employs memory, while yet it doesn’t involve physical acting or direct participation. In short, watching a film happens from the perspective of an audience, when the spectator is seated in front of the happening being watched, and is not physically located exactly next to it. Instead, the spectator and the happening are separated by a ‘fourth wall’ <sup>21</sup>. “While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes the actors act as if they cannot” <sup>22</sup>   – in fact, that also relates to dream spectatorship. The dreamer and the event of a dream itself are separated by the wall of an imaginary presence, where “The dreamer, in fact, is a spectator of his or her dream”. <sup>23</sup>
																</p>

																<p>
																	While the film spectator is awake, the dream spectator is asleep, which are, undoubtedly, exactly the opposite states. And yet, these states do have intertwined roots  – watching a film and watching a dream means being semi-present or ‘double present’, as beautifully said by Laura Rascaroli in her essay Oneiric Metaphor in Film Theory: “In the filmic image, as in dreams, we do not perceive a real presence, but the double of a presence”. <sup>24</sup>

																		<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“(…) it is really a challenge to accurately describe or communicate a dream.”  </em> <sup>25</sup>
																	</div>

																<p>
																	Dream image, narration, plot, logic and feel are very distinct, yet very fragile once dreaming is over. The <em>image</em> of a dream, meaning the whole visual scape one saw when dreaming, tends to be easily forgotten and is extremely hard to re-construct by other common mediums such as spoken language, the language of gestures or, say, creative means such as poetry or writing. One specific medium holds too much limitation to itself to be able to fully re-construct and translate the image of a dream in a most genuine and original sense. That is, also due to the fact that dreaming process isn’t associated with episodic memory and that often makes dreams so surreal: “The dream content is not linked with episodic memory that includes association of memory with specific time, place, or an event due to which dreams seem illogical and full of discontinuity.” <sup>26</sup>  For that fact, dream content is extremely hard to translate to another medium, however, there is one medium that achieved this very successfully and established a very unique concept of an oneiric film.
