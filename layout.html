    <header class="header"><font size="-1">✴︎</font> The Stories of Sensual Realities that Unite Us All <font size="-1">✴︎</font>  <p style="font-size:25px"><br>This thesis originates from the most sincere and personal fascination with dreams. I have entered this research with some basic elements of knowledge on dreams – I was only slightly familiar with the studies of dream symbolism, as well as with other aspect such as sleep phases. Nonetheless, I dare to call myself a passionate dreamer. I envision dreams as little capsules of stories of various kinds, which hold a lot of mystery.</br> <br>Those little stories composed of memories, reflections and predictions, embraced by the powers of imagination are enlived at night, and while being personal, they are also universal, because dreaming unites us all and it is, principally, a shared experience.<br></br>This thesis explores dreamers and the dream world through four main concepts: <sup>1</sup> protocols of dream shareability and the historical deconstruction of dream intimacy; <sup>2</sup> the relationship between the mechanisms of thought storage and dreaming; <sup>3</sup> the oneiric concept in cinema and <sup>4</sup> the notion of collective dreamscapes formed by the current influence of artificial intelligence and technologies. As the red thread through the stories, histories and concepts I researched for this thesis, I always refer to my own experience as a dreamer, because I find it important to keep it intimate, too.</p></header>
